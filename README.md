# IMPORTANT NOTICE

As you can tell, this repository is forked from a random competitive programming repository that I found on github. I don't want to edit it too much because there might be useful links here or there, but I'm mainly using this repository as a template to help edit in / store my own competitive programming solutions. This repository is forked from <a href=https://github.com/plskz/competitive-programming target="_blank">this repository</a>.
